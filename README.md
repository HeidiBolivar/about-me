## 👋 Thank you for being here! I'm Heidi: Following Curiosity into the Cloud ☁️

*Where Technology Meets Human Connection*

### ✨ It Started with a Conversation...

Isn't it funny how a single conversation can set you on a completely unexpected path? For me, technology wasn't always the plan. It truly clicked during a technology conference event when I was 16.

> I met a young woman, just a few years older, who was wrapping up her cybersecurity studies. Hearing her talk – not just about code or systems, but about the **real-world impact** of protecting information and empowering people – was electrifying. In that hour, something shifted. I saw technology not just as tools, but as a powerful way to solve problems and make a tangible difference. That spark ignited a curiosity that hasn't faded since.

### 🚀 From Spark to Skill: A Hands-On Journey

That conversation propelled me forward. I realized the best way to understand this potential was to dive in and **build things myself**. My journey started where many interactions do – focusing on people. In customer-facing roles, I learned the art of clear communication and the satisfaction of not just meeting, but **exceeding expectations**, often finding ways to make interactions **smoother and more efficient** for everyone involved. This foundation in understanding user needs felt essential as I pivoted towards the technical side.

My curiosity naturally led me to explore the infrastructure that makes modern tech possible, especially the cloud. I started experimenting, building, and occasionally breaking things (the best way to learn, right? 😉) within **Microsoft Azure**. If you peek at my [**GitHub Profile**](https://github.com/HeidiBolivar), you'll see some of these explorations:

*   **Bringing Order to Support:** I set up a functional **Help Desk system (osTicket)** on Azure VMs, configuring the web server (IIS) and database connections – a practical exercise in creating tools that help teams manage requests effectively. 🎫
*   **Demystifying Active Directory:** I built out a simulated on-premises **Active Directory** environment within Azure, getting my hands dirty with user accounts, group policies, and the fundamentals of enterprise identity management. 📁👤
*   **Peeking Under the Hood of Networks:** Using tools like **Wireshark** and configuring Azure's **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**, I started untangling how data flows and how to secure those pathways between virtual machines. 🌐🔒
*   **Exploring the AI Frontier:** The potential of AI fascinates me! My latest project involves tinkering with a toolkit using **AI assistants for text analysis and workflow automation** – exploring how these emerging tools might streamline technical tasks and free up human brainpower for more complex challenges. 🤖💡

### 🛠️ The Toolkit I'm Building

This hands-on work isn't just about checking boxes; it's about building a practical toolkit. Right now, that includes becoming increasingly comfortable with:

*   **☁️ Azure Cloud Essentials:** Navigating Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, and Network Security Groups.
*   **💻 Core Systems & Services:** Working with Windows 10, basic IIS, Active Directory concepts, and Help Desk workflows (especially **osTicket**).
*   **🌐 Networking Basics:** Understanding the flow of information and fundamental security principles.
*   **🤝 And importantly:** The soft skills honed through every interaction – **clear communication**, **analytical problem-solving**, a **collaborative spirit**, and an unshakeable belief in **continuous learning**.

### 🎓 Further Learning & Projects: 

I've been learning about some interesting things and doing some additional projects and wanted to share a bit of it here:

### 🔗 What's Next? Let's Connect!

My journey so far has solidified my interest in roles where I can directly apply these skills – particularly in **IT Support** or **Systems Administration**. I'm looking for a team where I can contribute to building and maintaining reliable systems, continue learning voraciously, and be part of making technology work *for* people.

If my path from that initial spark of curiosity to exploring the practicalities of Azure resonates with you, or if you're passionate about building user-focused IT solutions, I'd genuinely love to connect!
